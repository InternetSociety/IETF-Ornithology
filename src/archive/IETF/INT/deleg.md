    Within the DNS protocol the NS and DS records are used to signal to clients (resolvers) how the authority to serve and sign information within a specific part of the DNS is delegated. Within the DNS ops working group, there is a need to securely signal new technical capabilities such as the availability of authentication, confidentiality, and/or more efficient transport mechanism.
