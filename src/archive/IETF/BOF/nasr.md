Confidentiality on the Internet is established by end-to-end encryption of content. What path is taken by the stream of Internet Protocol packets that carry the encrypted content is usually ignored. 
The starting assertion of this work is that end-to-end encryption does not provide sufficient guarantees and that there are scenarios where one wants to make sure that the path over which data is being sent can be trusted to offer specific security guarantees. For instance, one would want to have certainty that data is not copied and recorded for decryption later (a common concern for when quantum computing becomes commercially viable).

A working group resulting out of this BoF would address the challenges associated with proving state and characteristics of a network path are compliant to a set of claims, so as to achieve predictable and verifiable forwarding behavior.

This working group forming BoF will discuss among other things the [proposed Charter](https://github.com/ietf-nasr/NASR-Charter).
