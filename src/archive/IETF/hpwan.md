# High Performance Wide Area Network (hpwan)
<IETFschedule>* Schedule Unknown</IETFschedule>
* [BoF request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-huang-hp-wan/)
* Keywords: QOS, high performance

This BoF seeks to identify requirement for the operation of high performance connections on shared potentially intercontinental networking infrastructure. It looks at use cases that are mostly relevant in scientific context such as those in high energy physics (e.g. the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG), multiple peta bytes are moved on a daily basis through a multiple-tier infrastructure spanning over 170 sites in over 40 countries)
