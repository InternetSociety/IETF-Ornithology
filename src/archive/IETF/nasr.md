# Network Attestation for Secure Routing (NASR) 
<IETFschedule>* Schedule Unknown</IETFschedule>
* [BOF Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-liu-nasr/)
* Potentially of interest because: supply chain security and potentially new controls for including/excluding the use of certain network segments.
* Keywords: Secure routing, supply chain trust

The goal of Network Attestation for Secure Routing work is to address the challenges associated with routing data on top of trusted devices, trusted operating environments, trusted links and trusted services only, to achieve transparent and predictable forwarding behavior. Verifiable operational correctness proofs should also be given to serve as a trusted evidence for visualization, internal inspection and external auditing.

In other words, this work tries to secure the network and routing supply chain from the ground up. This work will initially focus on intra-domain environments and is a building block for verifying the trustworthyness of the full stack in datacenters. 

The [requirements draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liu-nasr-requirements/) may be a good first step to understand further context of this work.

If this work ever covers inter-domain environments, careful analysis needs to be made of potential introductions of new controls.
