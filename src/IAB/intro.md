# The Internet Architecture Board
The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is a leadership body associated with the IETF. It provides long-range technical direction for Internet development and manages the relation of the liaisons of the IETF with other SDOs and other external bodies.

The IAB Open session is where the Internet Architecture board presents what it is doing. Usually, it includes discussions of topics about the Internet Architecture and an update on liaisons. The latter is interesting as it provides an insight as to how the IETF relates to other SDOs and technical bodies.
