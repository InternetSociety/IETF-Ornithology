One of the IAB's responsibilities is the RFC publication series. The RFC series has a stream for publishing technical work without being subject to IETF (and IAB, or IRTF) consensus. Those RFCs are therefore never IETF standards. 

The discussion during IETF 120 will be about guidance on the interaction between the IETF and the Independent submission area, for instance during publication of cryptography related documents in particular if those are based on cryptography developed in national or regional standard organizations.
