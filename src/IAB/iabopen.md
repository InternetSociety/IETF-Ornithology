# IAB Open
* <IETFschedule meets=true>IETF124: Thu 06 Nov 2025 11:30 - Place du Canada</IETFschedule>

The IAB Open meeting is where the IAB reports on its ongoing activities and presents on topics of architectural interest. 

The agenda is currently still being finalized but we expect first impressions from the [ IAB/W3C Workshop on Age-Based Restrictions on Content Access](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/agews/about/) that was recently held in London, and short updates on liaison relations of the IETF with other SDOs and the WSIS+20 review.
