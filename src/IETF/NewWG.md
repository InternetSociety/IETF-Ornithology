 * ART: [Domain Connect(DCONN)](./ART/dconn.html) was [chartered](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-dconn) 30 September, 2025
   This workingroup will standardize an existing industry specification that allows for application service providers to configure DNS entries directly with the DNS service providers, cutting out the error prone coordination between the two providers by the user. A high quality standard for this use case aids market diversity. We do not anticipate public policy impact.
