# New Working Groups

Below are the working group being chartered since IETF 124.
* SEC: PKI, Logs, And Tree Signatures(PLANTS) was [chartered](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-plants) 08 January, 2026

  This group works on the issues caused by the overhead when using post-quantum crypography. In the current PKI two system signatures are generated one for the certificate that is produced and one for the transperancy log. The validation of both signatures has notable size and latency impact on the establishment of encrypted connections. 

  Because the work is focused on optimizing an operational aspect of certificate management We do not anticipate public policy issues with this work.


The following groups are in the process of being (initially) chartered.

 * ART: Authenticated Transfer(ATP) ([charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-atp)).
