# New Working Groups

Below are the working group chartered since IETF 122.


 
 * ART: [Digital Emblems(DIEM)](ART/diem.md) was [chartered](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-diem) 27 May, 2025.<br>
 <br>
  For details see [elsewhere](ART/diem.md) in this document.  

 * SEC: HPKE Publication, Kept Efficient(HPKE) was [chartered](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-hpke) 08 May, 2025.<br>
 <br>
  This working group sets out to standardize an existing specification for a cryptographic building block and update it for post quantum resiliency. Beyond the fact that post quantum resiliency is an issue with public policy interest we do not identify any public policy issues in this working group itself.



 The following groups are currently being proposed:
 * ART: Domain Connect(DCONN)  ([charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-dconn)).<br>
 <br>
  Sets out to standarize an existing specification that eases the experience of the customers of service providers (e.g. hosting companies) that want to configure their DNS names. We identify no public policy issues.

 * GEN: Process Document Consolidation(PROCON)  ([charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-procon)).<br>
 <br>
   Consolidates a number of IETF policies and procedures. While we don't foresee public policy issues this group may be interesting for people who want to understand the intricacies of the IETF's governance.

 * OPS: SEcure access To Tls Local rEsources(SETTLE)  ([charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-settle)).<br>
 <br>
