* [About NMOP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/nmop/about/)
* Potentially of interest because: NOT so much - near time.

This working group focuses on the issues operators may face in managing their network now or in the future. Potentially comparing IETF solutions to those developed in other SDOs. This is a relatively new working group that may surface requirements from the industry.
