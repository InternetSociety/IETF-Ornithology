Network operators need to keep a record of what equipment is planned and installed in their networks (including a variety of information such as product name, vendor, product series, embedded software, and hardware/software versions). This group sets out to create the standardized building blocks needed to create such inventories. 

Network inventories may be constructed from management system data to represent the expected devices present in the network, and also be used to audit and catalog what devices are discovered in the network, and to expose that
information in a consistent way.
