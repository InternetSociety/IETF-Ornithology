 This group works on ways to measure and steer the energy use in networks. It intends to develop practical network operations building blocks and common reporting specifications. Building on earlier IETF community work such as the [IAB Workshop on Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and Systems(RFC9547)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9547.txt), an [RFC documenting requirements for energy management(RFC6988)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6988.txt), and an existing [energy management framework(RFC7326)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7326.txt) the working is chartered to _ explore use cases, derive requirements, and provide solutions for identifying and characterizing energy efficiency metrics, methods related to energy consumption of network devices, and optimizing energy efficiency across the network_

  Note that the charter declares out of scope several topics among which regulatory, compliance, and corporate responsibility-related matters.
