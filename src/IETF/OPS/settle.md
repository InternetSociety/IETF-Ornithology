SETTLE aims to provide practical deployment and operational guidance for creating a [secure context](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/) when servers run on local networks. As encryption is now standard on the public Internet, modern browsers increasingly require a secure context for web services. On local and private networks, this can make devices harder to use. It can also reduce overall security.
