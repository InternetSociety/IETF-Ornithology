# DNS Delegation(deleg)
* <IETFschedule>IETF124: Fri 07 Nov 2025 09:30 - Place du Canada</IETFschedule>
* [About ADD](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/deleg/about/) 
* Of interest because: potential (but unlikely) changes in business relations in the DNS value chain
* Keywords: operations, DNS

This working group proposes a mechanism to signal capabilities between the technical elements within the DNS ecosystem (Currently only NS and DS records). The charter explicitly requires _an operational impact assessment and include corresponding operational and deployment considerations sections in the specification._ We do not believe this work will significantly impact the business relations between registrars, registrants, registries, and nameserver operators. However, that assumption will need to be checked against these considerations.
