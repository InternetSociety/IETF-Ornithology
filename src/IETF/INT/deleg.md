# DNS Delegation(deleg)
* <IETFschedule>IETF122: Tue 18 Mar 2025 17:00 - Sala Thai Ballroom</IETFschedule>

* Keywords: operations, DNS

This working group proposes a mechanism to signal capabilities between the technical elements within the DNS ecosystem (Currently only NS and DS records). The charter explicitly requires _an operational impact assessment and include corresponding operational and deployment considerations sections in the specification._ We do not believe this work will significantly impact the business relations between registrars, registrants, registries, and nameserver operators. However, that assumption will need to be checked against these considerations.
