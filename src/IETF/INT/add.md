# Adaptive DNS Discovery (add)
* <IETFschedule meets=true>IETF125: Wed 18 Mar 2026 11:30 - Shangri-la Ballroom 2</IETFschedule>
* [About ADD](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/add/about/)
* Potentially of interest because: control over name resolution.
* Keywords: encryption, DNS

Encrypted DNS [DoH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8484/) and [DoT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7858/) as increased the security and privacy of users. However, in some network environments policies may require the use of specific resolution services. This working group develops discovery and selection mechanism for DNS clients in various environments. With the output of this group clients adopting encrypted DNS protocols can determine which DNS servers support those protocols, and which server to use for specific
queries if multiple servers are available. 
 
The group is chartered solely to develop technical mechanisms. Making any recommendations about specific policies for clients or servers is out of scope.
