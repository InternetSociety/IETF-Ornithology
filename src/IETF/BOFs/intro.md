# Birds of a Feather (BoFs) 

In general, BoFs or Bird of a Feather meetings are interesting because they discuss potential new streams of work. It is the place where new work often surfaces. Information on BoFs can be found on the [IETF data tracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bof-requests).[^note]

Here we enumerate all BoFs that we identified. We provide a high-level summary and indicate their relation to what *might* be policy interests. Readers are advised to follow the link in the title to gather more background about the BoF and find links to related Internet drafts and other prior art.

Often, before working groups are formed, meetings are organized to assess if there is enough clarity and interest around a particular issue to form a working group. 

At IETF125 there are two BOFs scheuled
    * [Operationalizing Network & SErvice abstractioNs(onsen)](./onsen.md)
    * [Coordinating Agent To Agent List of efforts(catalist)](./catalist.md)    

[^note]: BOF comes from “Birds of a feather flock together” an English proverb, also the inspiration for the esoteric title of this document.
