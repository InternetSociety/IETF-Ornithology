# Operationalizing Network & SErvice abstractioNs(onsen)
* <IETFschedule meets=true>IETF125: Tue 17 Mar 2026 09:00 - Grand Ballroom 1</IETFschedule>
* [BoF request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-clarke-operationalizing-network-service-abstractions-onions/)
* Potentially of interest because: we do not identify public policy interests
* Keywords: network management



A recent IAB [report on the NEMOPS workshop](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-iab-nemops-workshop-report/) captures complaints and suggestions of network operators—those that run complex networks. This  (working group forming) BOF uses that report as a starting point to at service abstractions.

Service abstractions can be used to simplify complexities in the network and make them easier to manage by hiding the complicated details and showing only the important parts.

This group will look at the operational workflows for deploying, monitoring, troubleshooting, and evolving service abstractions
