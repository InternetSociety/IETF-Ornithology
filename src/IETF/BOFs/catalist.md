# Coordinating Agent To Agent List of efforts (catalist)
* <IETFschedule meets=true>IETF125: Wed 18 Mar 2026 09:00 - Grand Ballroom 1</IETFschedule>
* [BoF request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-farrel-coordinating-agent-to-agent-list-of-efforts-catalist/)
* Potentially of interest because: Will give an overview of AI agent-to-agent work. 
* Keywords: AI

This is a non-WG-forming effort to coordinate among the various initiatives to develop IETF work on AI agent-to-agent communications.

    * Summarize the ecosystem, including work occurring outside the IETF at W3C, 3GPP, and the Linux Foundation
    *. Summarize work occurring in IETF side meetings and progressing on mailing lists.
    * Identify what work could be pursued in the IETF.
    * Identify and share existing IETF working groups that are addressing use cases related to agent communication.


The group will focus on 
    *  _Discovery and Interoperability_: Enabling agents built on disparate protocols to find and interact with one another
    *  _Agent-to-Agent Architectures_: Standardizing the interfaces and interaction models between independent AI agents
