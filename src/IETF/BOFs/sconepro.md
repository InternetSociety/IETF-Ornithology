For both network management and business motivation networks may impose constrains on the amount bandwidth available to users when streaming video. Currently, applications will adapt heuristically to this throttling by adapting the bit rate and therefore the quality of video streams. This group seeks to have the network signal attributes that allow the content to be adapted.

Path signaling elements may be vectors for control, abuse, and side channel attacks (i.e. learn something about the encrypted traffic). 

[RFC8558](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8558) and [RFC9419](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9419) provides general architectural guidance in this space.
