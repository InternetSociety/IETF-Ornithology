Intended to form a working group to address the specific impacts on transport (e.g. TCP and QUIC) and application protocols because of the use of Internet protocol (IP) networks in deeps space where round trip times and their variations are many times longer than on earth. Relevant because IP networks are specified in procurement for from US, European, and Japanese space agencies to build a flexible, extensible, and interoperable lunar communications and navigation architecture ([LunaNet](https://tempo.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/TEMPO?tab=lunanet)).
