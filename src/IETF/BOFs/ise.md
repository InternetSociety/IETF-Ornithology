# Independent Stream Open Meeting

<IETFschedule> </IETFschedule>
* Keywords: cryptography


The Internet Architecture Board is responsible for the RFC publication series. The RFC series has a stream for publishing technical work without being subject to IETF, IAB, or IRTF consensus. Those RFCs are therefore never IETF standards. 

The discussion during IETF 120 will be about guidance on the interaction between the IETF and the Independent submission area, for instance during publication of cryptography related documents such as those standardized by certain national or regional standard organizations and its relation to allocation of code points in protocols.
