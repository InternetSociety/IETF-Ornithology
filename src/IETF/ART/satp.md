# Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (satp) 
* <IETFschedule>IETF123: Mon 21 Jul 2025 17:00 - Patio 1</IETFschedule>
* [About SATP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/satp/about/)
* Of interest because: this specifies transfer of potentially regulated economic assets.
* Keywords: supply chain, digital public infrastructure, economic transaction.

The goal of SATP is to develop a protocol by which digital assets (e.g. a deed, or digital currency) can be transferred between gateways with the potential of having the transactions audited by 3rd parties. The legal frameworks that are at the basis of these transactions are out of scope for the working group. So are the audits and certifications of the implementations. 



[draft-ietf-satp-usecases/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/) provides a good overview of the use cases.
