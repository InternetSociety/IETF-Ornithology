<IETFornithology forcepublication=true />

* <IETFschedule meets=false>ATP likely does not meet at IETF125</IETFschedule>
* [Draft Charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-atp/)
* Potentially of interest because: Social media portability and interoperability and autonomy of users.
* Keywords:  Social media, (user) autonomy

The authenticated transfer protocol is at the base of the Bluesky social network. It uses self certifying datastructures to share information accross the network. Central to the idea is that authenticity and authority of the data is rooted in persistent user controlled idintifyer instead to network locations (A typical example of the latter is authentication based on the WEBPKI that is DNS based).

The technology allows user owned data to be portable across the network and provider independent and therefore enhances the agency of individual users.
