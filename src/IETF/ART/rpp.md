In the Domain Name System a lot of the business interaction between registry and registrar have been implemented using the Extentible Provisioning Protocol (EPP). Over the last decade industry has moved to other data transfer technology and this effort intends to modernize the functionality offered by EPP by offering so called restful interface. 

We expect low public policy impact because there is no fundamental shift in the nature of the communications between registry and registrar, only in the technical means.
