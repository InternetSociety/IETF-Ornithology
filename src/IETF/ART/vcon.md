* [About VCON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/vcon/about/)
* Of interest because: privacy issues involved in handling human conversations.
* Keywords: privacy, user data


This group is to define an open standard for transmission of conversational data such as chat logs, transcripts, and recordings. 

The charter explicitly mentions the privacy considerations: `There are privacy matters relevant to transcripts of the sort VCON is meant to standardize. VCON itself does not attempt to address these concerns directly, as that is intended to be handled by metadata in the layers above VCON itself. However, the documents produced by this working group will discuss such considerations, and will not preclude support for conveying important notions such as user consent.`
