The WIMSE working group will identify, articulate, and bridge the gaps and ambiguities in workload identity problems and define solutions across a diverse set of platforms and deployments, building on various protocols used in workload environments.

This work may have aspects related to platform interoperability and consumer (enterprises mostly) choice.

This work identifies on a specific type of technology within the broader workload ecosystem and liaises with IETF as well as external groups.
