# AI Preferences (aipref)

* [About AIPREF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/aipref/about/)
* Potentially of interest because: Copyright chapter - Measure 1.3(1)(a) of [The [EU] General-Purpose AI Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai)

This is a voluntary code, but one that the EU is putting a lot of pressure on AI vendors to adopt.

Content on the Internet is subject to scraping by agents and might be used as
input to the training of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as large
language models. This workgroup intends to design signalling mechanisms so that
the producers of content can indicate their preferences about how content is
collected and processed for AI model development, deployment and use.
