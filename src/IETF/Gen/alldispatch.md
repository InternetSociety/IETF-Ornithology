Dispatch sessions typical look at incoming documents to assess where in they IETF they should be handled, e.g. in a specific working group, or under the responsibility of an Area director. They are good meetings to identify new work.
 
Listed as a BOF because combining all dispatch sessions into one is still an experiment.
