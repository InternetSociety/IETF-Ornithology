Location-tracking accessories provide numerous benefits to users (such as being able to figure out where they left their keys this time!), but they can also have security and privacy implications if used to track other individuals without their knowledge or consent.

A community of stakeholders is seeking input from the IETF around the technical requirements and best practices to allow tracker manufacturers to build location-tracking accessories that will be compatible with unwanted tracking detection and alerts on mobile platforms.
