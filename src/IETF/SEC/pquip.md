# Post-Quantum Use In Protocols (pquip)
<IETFschedule meets=false></IETFschedule>
* [About PQUIP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/pquip/about/)
* Potentially of interest because: potential impact on (future) cybersecurity.
* Keywords: encryption, confidentiality, quantum resistance.  


As quantum computers evolve towards, the risk to encryption protocols we use in today’s network protocols grows. A timely transition to quantum safe protocols is required if we want long term confidentially and integrity for the communication today. This group sets out guidance for protocol developers to make that happen.
