The RASPRG aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, policymakers, standards users, and standards developers to study standardization processes across SDOs, with a particular focus on Internet standard-setting in the IETF. The research is aimed at informing the comprehension of standardization processes and policies, and possibly providing tools and insight.
