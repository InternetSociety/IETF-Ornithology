Quantum networking research is promising a set of exciting new opportunities, from new forms of encryption key distribution to networking between quantum computers.

Overall the goal of the QIRG is to address the question of how to design and build quantum networks, the research group intends to bridge the work done in the labs and the practical experience in the 'classical' Internet community.
